  Function takes contents for two files(splited in lines) to be compared,
  the default array of Strings that is the formated
  Strings stating the difference, usualy an empty array,
  and an integer counting up the number of rows.
  Usualy zero.
  Returning the formated report String from the parsing
  of the content.
